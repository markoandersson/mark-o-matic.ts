# Mark-o-matic.ts

An opinionated React/Redux-project boilerplate/example bootstrapped with create-react-app using Typescript, which tries 
to enforce good architectural constraints, and my opinion of React/Redux best practices.

Companion project with plain Javascript: [mark-o-matic.js](https://github.com/markoandersson/mark-o-matic.js)
