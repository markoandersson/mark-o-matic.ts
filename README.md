# Mark-o-matic.ts

An opinionated React/Redux-project boilerplate/example bootstrapped with create-react-app using Typescript, which tries 
to enforce good architectural constraints, and my opinion of React/Redux best practices.

## Stack

A companion project which has been implemented with plain Javascript: [mark-o-matic.js](https://github.com/markoandersson/mark-o-matic.js)

The technology stack is identical, excluding flow-type. The code has been modified to use Typescript types in all components, reducers and actions.

This project has been bootstrapped with `create-react-app` using the typescript-template.

`npx create-react-app [project-name] --template typescript`
